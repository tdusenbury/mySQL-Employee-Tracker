## Description 

This project is a specific type of database called CMS, or content management system. 

These types of databases allow a non-developer user an easy way to interact with database information. 

Utilizing the command-line in the terminal, a user can both view and add employees, departments, and roles.

Here is an image of the results of the query "View All Employees":

## Installation

The Slayer Sitch Tracker requires installation of mysql2, inquirer, console.table, dotenv, and figlet. After cloning down the repository, go to the command-line in the terminal and do an 'npm install' to install all the dependencies stated in the 'package.json' file.

## Usage 

Once the Slayer Sitch Tracker has been installed, the user will type 'node index-js' into the terminal command-line. A list of options is then presented to the user to view or add employees, roles, and departments. Each option will either auto-generate the requested information or ask a series of questions that, once answered, will be used to populate the corresponding chart which will then be displayed. To reset any additions back to the original list, enter 'mysql -u root -p' into the command-line, enter your login information, and then run the schema.sql and the seeds.sql.

## Learning Points

I love being organized and color-coding and sorting and all the things. 

Learning how to use SQL has been a joy.

Rules, order, structure....but also a lot of thinking about how to deconstruct and then reconstruct the information to show correctly.

I look forward to learning more about SQL and its various versions to see all the many things I can do with it!
